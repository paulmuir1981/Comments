# Comments
My task was to build a comments website

Assumptions made:
1. Everyone can see all comments and revisions
2. Only signed in users can add / edit comments
3. A user can only edit their own comments

Todo list of things I should add/modify:
1. Unit testing
2. Logging
3. Exception handling
4. Make it prettier!
5. Adapt out of the box website for own layout, etc
6. Adapt out of the box identity including roles and verification
7. Paging / sorting / filtering
8. Deleting comments / revisions
9. dot net core 3.0
